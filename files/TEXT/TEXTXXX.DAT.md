## Description

Contains the game's script; format not currently identified. Contains control data like character portraits along with the text itself.

Format appears to be identical between English and Japanese versions on the same platform, but differs between platforms.
iOS version is ported from the Saturn version and uses the same data format; its Japanese script is byte-for-byte identical to the Saturn version.
The iOS version includes scripts in both English and Japanese, both of which are in the Saturn's format.

## Files

Files TEXT000 through TEXT059 appear to contain dialogue, while TEXT100 and TEXT200 probably contain menu text.
The iOS version doesn't include TEXT100 and TEXT200, probably because it renders its menus differently from the other ports.
