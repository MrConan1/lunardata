## Description

A virtual filesystem bundling together most of the game's data, aside from its executables and streaming data.
This is only used in the PlayStation version; other ports have a more typical filesystem layout.
[Older versions](http://www.mediafire.com/file/6597al60vz2r3vm/biofat_svn06232011.zip) of the BioFat tool for Windows are able to open it.
