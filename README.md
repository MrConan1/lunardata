# About this project

This project contains my notes on the file formats used by [Lunar: Silver Star Story](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar:_Silver_Star_Story), the 32-bit remake of [Studio Alex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Studio_Alex)/[Game Arts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_Arts)'s game [Lunar: The Silver Star](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar:_The_Silver_Star).
I've tried to cover as many of the ports as possible, though I'm not covering the original Sega CD version or the other two remakes.

This project only covers this game, although the other two Saturn Lunar games contain similar data formats. I have a [separate repository](https://github.com/mistydemeo/magicaldata) with my notes on Magical School Lunar!.
